# Object-Oriented-Concepts-in-Java
This is my repository of code that is used for the Google Code-In Task "Object Oriented Concepts in Java".
It is a simple game written in Greenfoot. Please import the respective code and functions to Greenfoot to play. FlowerWorld is the world, all others are actors. 
Please then choose the appropriate images.
Or, forget about importing - just play the game online in the Greenfoot Site: https://www.greenfoot.org/scenarios/25103. Source code is published in a more organized way there.
